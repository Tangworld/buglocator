  known keywords:
 
  knownLimitation     Accepted limitation of current implementation (fails)
  purejava            Sources compile under javac as well
  brotest.txttest         ??
  messages-vary       one of many (usually ttest.txttest specs that differ only in
                      messages expected by the different compilers.
                      Currently ajc 1.0 tests are in ajcTests10.xml,
                      so there may only be one copy marked "messages-vary" here.
  new-messages-vary   like messages-vary, except need to make ajcTest10 variant

  fail-{...}      test.txttest fails in some configuration
  fail-unimplmented   eajc throwing "unimplemented" exception
  fail-commandLine    fails in ajc on command line (move to ajcTestsBroken.xml)
  fail-in-eclipse     fail when harness in run from inside eclipse
  fail-publicType     now fixed - no longer presenting error for public type in wrong file

  from-{file}         from original {file}.txt for file in
                      java, bigjava, resolved_1*, 14tests, errors, design, base... 

  incrementest.txttest    uses inc-compile step
  command-error       command-line ertest.txttest

  knownLimitation-ajctaskCompiler
                      Accepted limitation of the AjcTaskCompilerCommand wrapper
  knownLimitation-ajdeCompiler
                      Accepted limitation of the AJDE CompileCommand wrapper
                      
  poorErrorMessagetest.txttest case passes but errors produced by compiler could do with
                      improvement                      
                      
  Test titles:
  
  Titles should be unique and not change, and related tests should have the 
  same title prefix.  This permits us to automatically compare test.txttest results
  from different versions (and suites), and to see related differences together.
